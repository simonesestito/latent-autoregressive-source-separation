# LASS
This is a custom README file for the paper *Latent Autoregressive Source Separation*, for the
original readme of this repo see [here](README_old.md)

## Installation
Before running this code it is necessary to install an MPI implementation. On ubuntu, this can be done
simply by running the command
```bash
sudo apt-get -y install mpich
``` 
Installing the necessary dependencies can be done through conda, by executing the following commands:
```bash
cd lass_audio
conda env create -f environment.yaml
conda activate lass_audio
``` 
Once the conda environment is installed it is possible to start the separation procedure.

## Download Pre-trained models and data
You can download the necessary checkpoints from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1R50broLWAZwy0qSVezQRTy7EErQPHqnG/view?usp=share_link).
Place the downloaded file inside of the directory `lass_audio/checkpoints` and extract it with the command `tar -xf lass-slakh-ckpts.tar`.

The Slakh2100 test data can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Gf5SHVb8_o5NMbJAWaoULianX8RxzL4L/view?usp=share_link).
Similarly to before, place the downloaded file inside of the directory `lass_audio/data` and extract it with the command `tar -xf bass-drums-slakh.tar`

## Separate images
To separate you can run the script
```bash
PYTHONPATH=. python lass/separate.py
```
